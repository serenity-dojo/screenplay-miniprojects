These exercises are part of the [Serenity Dojo](http://www.serenity-dojo.com/) training program, and are designed to help developers and testers learn how to work with Serenity Screenplay on real-world applications.

## The problem domain

This repository contains a number of real-world projects for Serenity Screenplay students to experiment with. Each mini-project will involve writing realistic tests for a real-world website. In this exercise, you will be testing the booking system of the [South West Rail Website](https://buytickets.southwesttrains.co.uk/)]. 

The example will use the following persona:
 - *Tracy*, a student who likes to book her tickets at the last minute, and
 - *Bill*, a businessman who plans trips in advance and likes to travel in First Class

### Scenario 1 - The one where Tracy books a one-way ticket from Reading to Oxford leaving now

Tracy buys a single ticket from Reading to Oxford.

#### Expected outcomes 
She should see "Reading to Oxford" on the result page heading, and at least one matching trip. Add displayed trips should show the duration and the ticket type (e.g. "Off-peak day single"), and specify that the trips start at Reading and go to Oxford ("Reading > Oxford").
